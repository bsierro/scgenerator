* plot cli command should show by default, not save
* logger should hook to pbar when it exists
* find a way to make evaluator debugging easier

# Ideas

* have a `scan` section in the config to more granularly control parameter scanning. That way, the user provides single default values to all necessary parameters and then call the single-sim or scan commands to run the config accordingly.
