It is recommended to import scgenerator in the following manner :
`import scgenerator as sc`

# How to run a set of simulations
create a config file

run `sc.run_simulation(config_file)`

# How to analyse a simulation

Load completed simulations with the SimulationSeries class. The path argument should be that of the last fiber in the series (of the form `xx fiber A...` where `xx` is an integer)

The SimulationSeries class has basic plotting functions available. See the class documentation for more info

```
series = sc.SimulationSeries(path_to_data_folder)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
series.plot_2D(800, 1600, "nm", ax)
plt.show()
```

# Environment variables

`SCGENERATOR_PBAR_POLICY` : "none", "file", "print", "both", optional
    whether progress should be printed to a file ("file"), to the standard output ("print") or both, default : print

`SCGENERATOR_LOG_FILE_LEVEL` : "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "critical", optional
    level of logging printed in $PWD/scgenerator.log

`SCGENERATOR_LOG_PRINT_LEVEL` : "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "critical", optional
    level of logging printed in the cli.

# Configuration

You can load parameters by simply passing the path to a toml file to the appropriate simulation function. Each possible key of this dictionary is described below. Every value must be given in standard SI units (m, s, W, J, ...)
the root of the file has information concerning the whole simulation : name, grid information, input pulse, ...
Then, there must be a `[[Fiber]]` array with at least one fiber with fiber-specific parameters.

Parameters can be variable (either in the root or in one fiber). if at most one single `[variable]` dict is specified by section, all the possible combinations of those variable parameters are considered. Another possibility is to specify a `[[variable]]` array where the length of each set of parameter is the same so they're coupled to each other. 

Examples : 

```
n2 = 2.2e-20
```
a single simulation is ran with this value
```
[variable]
n2 = [2.1e-20, 2.4e-20, 2.6e-20]
```
3 simulations are ran, one for each value
```
n2 = 2.2e-20
[variable]
n2 = [2.1e-20, 2.4e-20, 2.6e-20]
```
NOT ALLOWED. You cannot specified the same parameter twice.

Here is an example of a configuration file

```
# these be applied to the whole simulation fiber PM1550_1 only
# fiber parameters specified here would apply to the whole simulation as well
# unless overridden in one of the individual fiber
name = "Test/Compound 1"

field_file = "Toptica/init_field.npz"
repetition_rate = 40e6
wavelength = 1535.6e-9

dt = 1e-15
t_num = 16384
tolerated_error = 1e-6
quantum_noise = true
z_num = 32
mean_power = 200e-3
repeat = 3


[[variable]]
spm = [true, false]
raman_type = ["agrawal", "stolen"]

[[Fiber]]
name = "PM1550_1"
n2 = 2.2e-20
dispersion_file = "PM1550/Dispersion/PM1550XP extrapolated 1.npz"
length = 0.01
effective_mode_diameter = 10.1e-6

[[Fiber]]
name = "PM2000D_2"
length = 0.01
n2 = 3.4e-20
A_eff_file = "PM2000D/PM2000D_A_eff_marcuse.npz"
dispersion_file = "PM2000D/Dispersion/PM2000D_1 extrapolated 0 4.npz"

[Fiber.variable] # this variable parameter will be applied to PM2000D_2
input_transmission = [0.9, 0.95]
```

this means that only `(spm=true, raman_type="agrawal")` and `(spm=false, raman_type="stolen")` are considered and not `(spm=false, raman_type="agrawal")` for example. In the end, 12 simulations are ran with this configuration.



## Fiber parameters
If you already know the Taylor coefficients corresponding to the expansion of the beta2 profile, you can specify them and skip to "Other fiber parameters":

beta2_coefficients: list-like
    list of Taylor coefficients for the beta_2 function

If you already have a dispersion curve, you can convert it to a npz file with the wavelength (key : 'wavelength') in m and the D parameter (key : 'dispersion') in s/m/m. You the refer to this file as

dispersion_file : str
    path to the npz dispersion file


else, you can choose a mathematical fiber model

model: str {"pcf", "marcatili", "marcatili_adjusted", "hasan"}
