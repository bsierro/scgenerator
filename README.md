It is recommended to import scgenerator in the following manner :
`import scgenerator as sc`

# How to run a set of simulations
create a config file

run `sc.parallel_simulations(config_file)` or `sc.simulate(config_file)`

# How to analyse a simulation

load data with the load_sim_data method
spectra, params = load_sim_data("varyTechNoise100kW_sim_data")
    to plot
        plot_results_2D(spectra[0], (600, 1450, nm), params)

# Environment variables

SCGENERATOR_PBAR_POLICY : "none", "file", "print", "both", optional
    whether progress should be printed to a file ("file"), to the standard output ("print") or both, default : print

# Configuration

You can load parameters by simply passing the path to a toml file to the appropriate simulation function. Each possible key of this dictionary is described below. Every value must be given in standard SI units (m, s, W, J, ...)
The configuration file can have a ```name``` parameter at the root and must otherwise contain the following sections with the specified parameters. Every section ("fiber", "gas", "pulse", "simulation") can have a "variable" subsection where parameters are specified in a list INSTEAD of being specified as a single value in the main section. This has the effect of running one simulation per value in the list. If many parameters are variable, all possible combinations are ran.
Examples : 

```
n2 = 2.2e-20
```
a single simulation is ran with this value
```
[variable]
n2 = [2.1e-20, 2.4e-20, 2.6e-20]
```
3 simulations are ran, one for each value
```
n2 = 2.2e-20
[variable]
n2 = [2.1e-20, 2.4e-20, 2.6e-20]
```
NOT ALLOWED


note : internally, another structure with a flattened dictionary is used



## Fiber parameters
If you already know the Taylor coefficients corresponding to the expansion of the beta2 profile, you can specify them and skip to "Other fiber parameters":

beta: list-like
    list of Taylor coefficients for the beta_2 function

If you already have a dispersion curve, you can convert it to a npz file with the wavelength (key : 'wavelength') in m and the D parameter (key : 'dispersion') in s/m/m. You the refer to this file as

dispersion_file : str
    path to the npz dispersion file


else, you can choose a mathematical fiber model

model: str {"pcf", "marcatili", "marcatili_adjusted", "hasan"}
